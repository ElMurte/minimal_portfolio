# minimal_portfolio

A new Flutter project about a simple minimal portfolio written in flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a minimalistic portfolio developer,
to showcase some of my work.

1. If you like it or use it give me a star
2. change the code as you prefer...
3. flutter build web (from the directory)
4. SEO needs to be added manually (after compilation)
    - title ex. <title>Name Surname</title>
    - meta tags...(ex. <meta name="description" content="Explore the portfolio of <Name Surname> build with Flutter, a passionate developer based in the <Country>. ">)
Optional:
Host the website somewhere (ex. https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
