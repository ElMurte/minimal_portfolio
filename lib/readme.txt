#REFACTOR CLASSES TO USE BUILDLAYOUT AND SWITCH SIZES...
USE FUNCTION FOR THE REST OF THE CODE

LIKE 
(){
    CHILD:
    CONSTRAINT.MAXSIZE>600
    BUILDLAYOUT1:BUILDLAYOUT2....
}

USE A STATE MANAGEMENT TO GIVE DYNAMIC SIZES DOWN TO THE WIDGETS

SAME FOR THE COLOR THEMES CHANGE TO THEME COLOR SO
ITS EASY TO SET IT UP...


IN THE MAIN OR THE PROVIDER ADD THE CONTENTS OF YOUR
NEEDS LIKE NAME PROJECTS....
SO ITS IN ONE PLACE TO CHANGE THEM...
...A LOT STILL TO DO BUT YOU GOTHCA...
